'''we define E to be the event in which the sum rolled by two evenly-weighted dice is > 9

The set of outcomes satisfying E is: {(4,6),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(5,6)} we can use this to find:

P(E) = |E|/|S| = 6/36 = 1/6

we want to find the probability of sum being <= 9 . Because we hace P(E) and we know that the probability we want
comprises the rest of the sample space, we calculate it as follows: 1- P(E) = 1-1/6 = 5/6'''
